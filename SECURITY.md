## Reporting a Vulnerability

We value security for the project very highly. We encourage all users to report any vulnerabilities they discover to us.

If you've discovered a security vulnerability in the tool, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner, using [this form](https://forms.gle/b5dqvbwgd71ShgEMA).
