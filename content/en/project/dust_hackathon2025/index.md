Groundbreaking demo showcasing our innovative AI agent, designed to streamline bug fixes and enhance productivity! ðŸš€

In this project, we dive into the capabilities of our AI agent, built during the Echathan event. This agent is a game-changer for non-technical users like Project Managers (PMs) and Customer Success Managers (CSMs), empowering them to fix functional bugs without involving the engineering team.

Why This Matters:

    Time-Saving: Reduce the workload on your engineering team.
    Customer Satisfaction: Fix bugs faster and keep your customers happy.
    Efficiency: Streamline your workflow and minimize frustration.

Join us on this journey as we make bug fixing smarter, faster, and more efficient. Stay tuned for more updates and innovations! ðŸŒŸ

Technical Stack Details:
* Smolagents
* MCP (GitHub)
* Python
* Dust.tt API
* Notion

Team12 composed by: Simon Cleriot, Khaled Khebbeb, Jarek Ecke & David Aparicio.
