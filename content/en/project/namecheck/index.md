A very simple command line tool and server to check the availability of a nickname/handle on Twitter and GitHub. This toyproject is used for my demos at conferences like [Security from the beginning of the design of a project](/talk/la-securite-des-le-debut-de-la-conception-dun-projet/) as well as for the article Programmez! Hors s√©rie #8. This Go application is a fork of the opensource project of [@jub0bs](https://github.com/jub0bs/), also available on [GitHub](https://github.com/jub0bs/namecheck).
