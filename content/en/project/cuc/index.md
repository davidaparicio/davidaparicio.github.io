CUC (English pronunciation: [_cuc_] / λευκός) is a very simple CLI tool to check various HTTP status for example if a webpage is available (200) or not found (404).

> It's delicious like a [TUC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TUC_(cracker)) (cracker), Biscuit of the French company LU, but with a C, for the [Console](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface).
