summary: Since the entry into force of the GDPR, the protection of personal data (PII) as well as security "by design" become central topics
abstract: "In 2020, the number of cyberattacks has exploded worldwide. According to a recent report from the French National Agency for Information Systems Security (ANSSI), ANSSI operations in 2020 have increased fourfold, compared to the previous year.

The Covid-19 pandemic has multiplied the opportunities for destabilization (cyber attacks) in several sectors, including health: Rouen University Hospital, Narbonne, Montpellier, Dax, Villefranche-sur-Saône, Oloron-Sainte-Marie, Saint-Gaudens ... The list of hospitals is getting longer.
Moreover, since the RGPD came into force, the protection of personal data as well as the security 'by design' become central subjects in our projects.

I will present the techniques used and I will also talk about the management's awareness of these important aspects.
Indeed, even being in the internal network of a datacenter, we are not safe from an intrusion. The 0 risk does not exist.
