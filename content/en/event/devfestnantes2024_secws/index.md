summary: DevSecOps, step by step
abstract: "You probably know about Linux [Install Parties](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Install_party)? Then let's do the same with Security, we will follow the [DevSecOps](https://davidaparicio.gitlab.io/website/files/devsecops_software_lifecycle.jpg) approach of the [US Department of Defense](https://public.cyber.mil/devsecops/). For that, nothing could be easier, come with your computer, your opensource project and your tools (IDE, CI/CD). After a few presentation slides, we will go step by step through the security of your application. If your application is dockerized, we will evoke the [good practices of the ANSSI](https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/guide/recommandations-de-securite-relatives-au-deploiement-de-conteneurs-docker/) on this subject. We will see, through this workshop, how GitOps/CI/CD allow us and organizations to improve our posture towards security."
