summary: Meetup, DevSecOps with Gosec
abstract: "Gosec is a security tool designed for analyzing Go source code to identify potential security vulnerabilities. It is a static analysis tool, which means it examines the code without executing it. 

Gosec is commonly integrated into continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to automate security checks as part of the build process. This helps ensure that security vulnerabilities are caught and addressed early, reducing the risk of security issues in production code."
