summary: Deputy-Chairman/Organiser of Tech&Wine
abstract: "I played an active role in organising this first edition of Tech&Wine. Tech & Wine, a unique fusion of technology and conviviality, took place on June 18, 2024, in the magnificent setting of the Château de Montchat in Lyon.

Imagine a day dedicated to sharing knowledge in the fields of Craftsmanship, Data/ Artificial Intelligence, and Cloud/DevOps, followed by an exclusive after-work event to taste wines with the Pharm'o'verre association. That's Tech & Wine: captivating conferences selected by Software Crafters Lyon, Lyon Data Science, Café DevOps Lyon, and Cloud Alpes, followed by a relaxed evening of wine tasting.

Tech & Wine is also an initiative to help young winemakers in the region promote their wines. They will be on hand to share their knowledge and products with you."
