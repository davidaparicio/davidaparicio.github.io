summary: The latest fashionable tools for your terminal
abstract: "As developers, we spend more than 50% of our time on design and code review. The other part is spent on the command line interface of the IDE or the OS terminal: launching the application, debugging, reading logs, updating dependencies, analyzing network frames... Is it possible to save time? Have you taken the time to configure your terminal? That's what we'll see. I'll share a set of best practices and aliases for your favorite command line.

On your marks, ready? Kaizen! kaizen = continuous improvement"
