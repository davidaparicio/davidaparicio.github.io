summary: Meetup, special DevSecOps
abstract: "In 2020, the number of cyberattacks exploded worldwide. According to a recent report by the French National Cybersecurity Agency (ANSSI), ANSSI operations in 2020 increased fourfold compared to the previous year.

The Covid-19 pandemic has multiplied opportunities for destabilization (cyberattacks) in several sectors, including healthcare: Rouen, Narbonne, Montpellier, Dax, Villefranche-sur-Saône, Oloron-Sainte-Marie, and Saint-Gaudens university hospitals... The list of hospitals is growing.

Furthermore, since the GDPR came into force, personal data protection and security by design have become central issues in our projects.

David will present the techniques used and also discuss management awareness of these important aspects. Even when we are on a data center's internal network, we are not immune to intrusion. There is no such thing as zero risk."
