abstract: "As part of a mission at AMADEUS, I had to implement a LINUX daemon to save Kerberos information, in order to be able to recreate this virtual machine as soon as possible, according to the Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP, PRA, PCA). Since this information is important and critical, I applied the SecurityByDesign paradigm. By configuring a specific user, the exchange of keys, the use of a trusted authority already present, are some of the techniques used. In addition to the story telling, I will give keys to facilitate the discussion with the management."
