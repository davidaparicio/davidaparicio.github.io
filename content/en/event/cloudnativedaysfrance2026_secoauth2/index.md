summary: Let's simplify security for our developers
abstract: "In many companies, it is common to encounter internal applications that do not offer native user management. And leaving security to developers can be complex and risky. This lightning talk introduces you to OAuth2-Proxy, an open source, cloud-native reverse proxy that acts as universal protection for your applications without modifying their code. 

With OAuth2-Proxy, you can delegate authentication to an external provider (Google, Azure, Keycloak, etc.), ensuring a secure, centralized connection for all your users. In just 10 minutes, explore how to quickly protect your applications, manage access via IdPs (identity providers), and simplify all authentication issues, all with a live demo accessible to everyone, even without advanced application security skills."
