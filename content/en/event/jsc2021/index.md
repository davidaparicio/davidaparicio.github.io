summary: Failure as a source of knowledge
abstract: "Failure as a source of knowledge. Can we learn from the mistakes of the big companies?
To do this, we will review some of the major outages of the last decade: Github, Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, Gitlab or more recently Fastly. Through the reading of the post-mortems of the incidents, we will analyze the root cause, the implementation of the remediation, and extract some good practices"
