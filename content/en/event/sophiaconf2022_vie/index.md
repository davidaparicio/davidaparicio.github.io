summary: Failure as a source of knowledge
abstract: "Failure as a source of knowledge. Can we learn from the mistakes of the big tech (companies)? To do so, we will review some of the major outages of the last decade: Github, Amazon, Google, OVHcloud, Apple, Fastly, Microsoft, Gitlab or more recently Facebook. Through the reading of the post-mortems of the incidents, we will analyze the root cause, the implementation of the remediation, and extract some good practices ~ IaaS (Interruption as a Sageness) #HugOps"
