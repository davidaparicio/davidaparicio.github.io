summary: Like the synonym, only worse, especially in administration
abstract: "Imagine yourself, alone & the only [FIRST NAME] on Earth, a smooth school career, with a perfect family. Everything is going well, when suddenly, at an administrative stage, you realize that you have a namesake. And yes, it is possible, same name, same first name and same date of birth.

I'm going to tell you about this nightmare that makes all the procedures more difficult: for example, permits, CAF and even my Covid-19 antigenic tests. Nothing but experience! (Around the fire format, slideless 15 minutes)"
